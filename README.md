## StockExperience - The best way to learn how to invest in stocks!

This repo contains my school project, which enabled my younger colleagues to delve into the unknown world of stocks.
What this app does is that it enables people to put their skills into test and see how they perform and understand investing in stocks. 
In fact, it is the only program right noe which uses indexes from Polish GPW.
It also supports Forex
